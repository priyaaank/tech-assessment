## Code conventions
### Mental model
Conventions on a large team are powerful. They lend familiarity and allow team to work in synchronization while reducing communications overhead. Even if code is not written in an ideal structure, if conventions are followed diligently, code will be predictable and easy to navigate. In legacy code base, strong conventions can lend ease of maintainance and onboarding. 

### Benefits (_of a strong convention system_)
